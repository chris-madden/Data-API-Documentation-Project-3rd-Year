#Introduction

This project is using the dataset 'Galway City Parking Locations' which can be found at the following url https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-city-car-parking-locations. The design and documentation for the dataset is below.

#About the dataset

The dataset is originally in the CSV (comma separated values) format and is formatted into json. The dataset can be found and downloaded from https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-city-car-parking-locations/resource/d967950d-faab-45ad-815d-211c9bcfb38e.

The dataset has 17 rows and covers all public car parks in the city. This dataset will continue to grow as it is expanded to to cover the surrounding areas of Galway City. 

The dataset contains 12 fields which includes different grid systems for locating the car parks.
The first 2 fields are an older coordinates system and may not be of use to you, we recommend you ignore these and choose one of the more up to date coordinate systems
